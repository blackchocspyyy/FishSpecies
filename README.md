# Hydroacoustic-Based Fish Species Classification
### For Prof. Leos Barajas, please check the Progress Report/ folder directly. It contains the most up-to-date code and processed data.

This project explores machine learning and deep learning approaches for fish species classification using hydroacoustic data. Traditional monitoring methods like trawling and netting are costly and disruptive to aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to classify Lake Trout (LT) and Smallmouth Bass (SMB) based on sound wave reflections at different frequencies.

The research extends previous work by Leivesley and Professor Leos Barajas (2024) and aims to improve classification accuracy to at least 80% while identifying key frequency patterns.
